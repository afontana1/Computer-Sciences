# Database tracking mass shootings & interactive visualization

## Process

- Using data from [gunviolencearchive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting) and [StanfordGeospatialCenter](https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/MSA) to create a database of mass shootings since 2014. [Geocoder](https://github.com/DenisCarriere/geocoder) or [Geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) will be used to map the city names to latitude and longitude. We will also look at [the police shootings database](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings) provided by Washington Post.
